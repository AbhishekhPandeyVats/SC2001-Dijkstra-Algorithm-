# SC2001-Dijkstra-Algorithm-
In the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, the choice of the input graph representation and the priority queue implementation will affect its time complexity. 
In this project, we evaluate the performance of Dijkstra's algorithm in 2 scenarios

1. Using a graph stored in an adjacency matrix and an array for the priority queue
2. Using a graph stored as an array of adjacency lists and a minimising heap for the priority queue

We then compare the time complexity of each algorithm and discuss which implementation is better and in which circumstance
